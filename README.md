# Lexical Editor Playground (Template)

This repository provides a **template** for setting up a playground environment using [Lexical](https://lexical.dev), a fast, extensible, and accessible text editor framework.  
It is intended as a starting point for experimenting with Lexicalâ€™s core features and building custom editor experiences.

The project is developed with:

- **React**
- **Vite**
- **TypeScript**

It can also be packaged as a **custom element** so it can be used inside other JavaScript frameworks such as **Angular**, **Vue**, or plain JavaScript as an independent component.
